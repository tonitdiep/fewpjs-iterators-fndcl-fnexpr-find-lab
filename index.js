    }


    // Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js that: * Receives 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects 
    // * Each object has two properties: year and result * Use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win! 
    // * superbowlWin() should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!). If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined


    // Array.find() is a built-in function in JavaScript
    // which is used to get the value of the first element
    // in the array that satisfies the provided condition. 
    // With this, you can quickly check all the elements of 
    // the array and returns the first match.
